I scored a clip from Bridgerton as part of a competition by Spitfire Audio.

The piece is, per the film, divided into four separate sections with contrasting tones, and thus illicits different emotions from the film. Taking inspiration from the many romantic-comedy film soundtracks I've listened to (in particular Rachel Portman's score from "Chocolat" and Hans Zimmer's "The Holiday" score), the score to the clip uses rapid ostinatos to convey the panic and anxiety experienced by various characters in the film, while a shimering string chorale is used in scenes of tension or strong emotions.

The film can be watched below (released on August 23, 2022):
