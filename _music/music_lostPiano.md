"The Lost Piano" is a short film scored as part of a competition by Westwood Instruments to celebrate the release of their eponymous sound library.

Composing music for this film is quite fun, in particular the core idea of the film. The main motif is introduced when the idea of 'memento mori' is discussed & fleshed out by the narrator. Meanwhile, the idea develops as he narrates & is subtly drawn to the piano at the climax.

This eventually forms into a theme near the end once the narrator has accepted the principle (the melody actually follows the spoken rhythm of 'memento mori').

The film can be watched below (released on December 7, 2021):
