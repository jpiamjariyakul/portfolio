> Note: all of these are 100% my opinions. I will try to present my arguments as academically as possible, but note that these analyses (be it film, literature, poetry, or music) are empirically deduced over my growing media consumption. I also did not study music in school & university so I have no doubt some things will go amiss in that department..!

The monomyth, also known by its arguably more popular name "The Hero's Journey", is a tried-and-true story structure that have shaped storied that we've encountered throughout human history.

# On story structures

Before we discuss this monomyth any further, let us briefly discuss what this monomyth actually is, and if there are any similar structures, or similar analogues between different media.

## JC's "Hero with a Thousand Faces"

## The three-act structure

# Concert works' implementation of the framework

# What about in film music?

## Lord of the Rings (Howard Shore)

TBD
