Hi, welcome to my first blogpost on this website.

# Purpose of blog

The main purpose of this blog is to provide a platform where I can share my thoughts on all-things, showcase my music, share my poems, and a general-purpose landing page.

I may also post movie/concert/album reviews of (well) movies, concerts, or albums that I had watched/listened, and a day in a life of someone living in Cambridge as a grad not from an Oxbridge university. I may also post info about tech and what I'm doing in my work (obviously NDA-pending...), and the casual day-to-days of being in Cambridge or Bristol.

# Tools used

This site is built on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), a static site framework that allows the writer (ie me!) to build static sites without much maintenance. This involves using HTML & CSS (the main languages of building websites), Liquid, and Markdown (this blog post is written entirely on a `.md` file!). I will definitely post a tutorial/quickstart on getting a blog running at some point in the future.

# Contacts

The best way to reach me is via [email](mailto:j.piamjariyakul@outlook.com), but I am also reachable on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jpiamjariyakul).

<!-- 
You’ll find this post in your `_posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run `jekyll serve`, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
