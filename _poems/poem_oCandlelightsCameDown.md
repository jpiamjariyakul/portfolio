>
O' candlelights came down<br>
From memories fleet and grey<br>
'Midst the angels' calls from heav'ns<br>
Laid upon the earth and said:<br><br>
"O' ye shepherds! Seek the manger<br>
To the Christ-head, where He lays<br>
Down from stars, before the gentiles<br>
Go, ye shepherds, to Bethlehem!<br><br>
O' Lamb of Light, the Highest!<br>
May you ne'er softly cry nor weep<br>
For thine radiance saved the sinned<br>
Whose hearts He shalt e'er keep!"<br><br>
**Adoro te devote!<br>
Hosanna in excelsis!<br>
Gloria in excelsis!<br>
Allelu-**<br><br>
O' silent Child of morning,<br>
As the Dove proclaimed the Rose,<br>
Let the Light be indelibly<br>
Withstanding ev'n through our close<br><br>
So sleep, ye Child, and dream<br>
Of that Light so long ago:<br>
Of **Alleluia**!

Full disclaimer: I'm not a religious person, but I am rather spiritual in nature & genuinely love the Christmas season & what it means (for Christians and non-Christians alike). And as someone who grew up with singing Christmas carols, the holiday season is a very cosy one, and I'd love to give back to a festival that lets me feel like a child again.

Christmas carols are an anomaly for me: when writing music, I often try to make the words profound and adhere to a melancholic and/or hopeful sound world that I set this 'box' in, and would try to (for a lack of a better word) make it as 'academic' as possible. Carols, on the other find, I find to be a playground where I can be my jolliest self & write beautiful music without worrying (nor caring) too much about what I write.

The text to this poem (often times I write the text first - the music might be developed in tandem with text, but composition-wise text often comes first) was written to tell the story, from a mother to a child, of the story of Christmas and the newborn Christ-child. The core words are:

>
So sleep, ye Child, and dream of that Light so long ago

The remaining text revolved around that core idea. Eventually the first draft was tweaked heavily (after feedback & valuable criticisms regarding the text) & reflected the story much more nicely.

Personally, I find the test a bit lackluster, and will likely change some of the text (especially the multitudes of "the" occuring throughout the piece). I may also secularise the piece for a winter-themed poem.
