>
Rest your weary, with'ring rose:<br>
Browned petals of murk and tide<br>
Yet, thousand storms, you never bide<br>
Drowned in your evening's woe?<br><br>
Rest, the mead a-wash your tire<br>
Its tender brace (of silver boon,<br>
a soothing glim) 'mongst watery dunes<br>
And quell your wand'ring ire<br><br>
Rest for morrow's lanterned day!<br>
Shadows fall (in distant fells,<br>
heathers shall bloom!) upon these spells<br>
To light your midnight way

This poem was written right after wrapping up & releasing the choral piece "Home", envisioned as a direct prequel-sequel poem (not dissimilar to the Star Wars prequels) on the same topic of mental health. This poem speaks of recovery and knowing that, from the deepest pits, there is light & that we are never alone. It would eventually lend itself into forming a part of a multi-movement poetry cycle (which I am currently working on) - this will be elaborated in a future blog/poem post.

<!--- The poetry cycle (ergo the eventual song cycle, whenever that gets finished..!) intends to speak of mental health and loneliness & isolation, and generally intends to bring hope to the reader/listener. Mental health is a topic that I believe, if one is to create pieces of art around it, should be as sincere and accessible as possible - art is a tool in which we can help people project their feelings upon, and perhaps find some light in the eyes.

As of May 2022, there are nine poems planned in the cycle, with each poem conveying a different stage and narrative of despair & recovery (that I personally went through - you are not alone in this!). --->
