>
As one chapter comes to close<br>
Look to the stars, in grand delight<br>
Spread thine wings of brazen gold<br>
And take flight<br><br>
Whence the lark e'er softly sings<br>
T'wards the gently lanterned day<br>
Indelibly - Memoirs; doth pring<br>
Those works and plays...<br><br>
To the stars of crystal'd free<br>
Go thine way but ne'er a-bye<br>
Ev'n foams apart; In jubilee,<br>
Go forth...<br>
  And fly!
***

This poem was written for a friend, SH, and her graduation ceremony in April 2022.
