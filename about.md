Jay Piamjariyakul is an engineer and amateur musician based in Cambridge, UK.

# Engineering

Jay grew up in Thailand and was exposed to computers and electronics at an early age. During his study at Strathallan School (in Perthshire, UK), he had been consistently enthusiastic about software and computing & architecture, and even developed some computer games in his free time.

In 2017, Jay began studying Electrical and Electronic Engineering at University of Bristol (in Bristol, UK). Graduating in 2021 with a Master of Engineering (in Electrical and Electronic Engineering) with First Class Honours, his thesis is on "A novel Make-Up Gain stage for the software-based Moog 4-pole audio filter" ([download link]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pdf/thesis.pdf)) as supervised by Dr. Paul Hill.

Jay eventually found his specialty in DSP, hardware & software programming, and audio applications. As of 2021, he is currently a Verification Engineer at Arm Ltd, working directly on the latest generations of generic interrupt controllers. His graduate work had been presented in the company's internal Methodology Summit in April 2022.

# Music

Outside of engineering, Jay is also an amateur singer and hobbyist composer with interest in choral and film music. He received private tuition on piano and violin at an early age (which he disliked), and received singing lessons with Miss Boyd (regrettably Jay couldn't recall her forename), eventually achieving Grade 5 Music Theatre and Grade 6 Singing from ABRSM. Aside from singing, Jay also began composing music since 2014 (self-taught and influenced by his film composer heroes) and hasn't stopped since, taking influences from film/cinematic, traditional choral, jazz/rock/blues, and electronic music into his composition style.

In his time at University of Bristol, Jay began writing numerous pieces for orchestras, ensembles, and choirs. He was the conductor of the Music Society's Wind Orchestra from 2020-21 and over Spring of 2020 delivered a series of mini-lectures on film music composition. He also composed the music to the Wildlife Film Society's short film "The Murmuration" by Alice Geary. Jay began his dive into choral composition in late 2020, and premiered his first choral concert work in March 2021.

Jay is currently singing with University of Cambridge's Magdalene College Chapel Choir directed by Graham Walker (as of 2022), and is currently composing one of his longest choral works yet. He is currently the Marketing Officer with Elysium Orchestra, set up by Enyi Okpara.

He also composed a number of poems over his school days, and after a hiatus began writing poetry again in 2020.

Jay is open to composing opportunities (be it film, choral, or concert - even writing poetry!); if you are interested please do not hesitate to get in touch.

And yes, Jay still plays with LEGO. He regrets nothing.
