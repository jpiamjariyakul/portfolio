# Skills & Proficiencies
## Technical Skillsets
- Experienced with FPGA & embedded SoC development with V/SV/UVM/VHDL/C/C++ utilising ModelSim & Xilinx ISE
- Adept in object-oriented programming concepts, general data structures & algorithms, version control with Git, CRUD systems, and web/software development in HTML/CSS, Python/JavaScript, and MATLAB
- Capable with advanced electronics concepts, circuitries & operations, including System-on-Chip & bridge design, digital & analogue circuit design, and able in communication system concepts (including mobile) and network principles
- Previous experiences with microcontrollers and its languages in personal, internship & university-related projects, i.e. Arduino, Raspberry Pi, TI LaunchPad

## Problem Solving & Creativity
- Developed a set of prototype methods for collecting coverage data from functional verification & image quality metrics given top-level specifications with Python & SV as part of my Arm internship scheme, and designed database methods for storing & querying the collected information.
- Designing & fabricating a Rubik’s Cube puzzle-solving robot from minimal requirements, with concerns to resource efficiency, performance, design choices, longetivity, and output verification.
- Designed a PNM to PGM conversion (and vice versa) in C & an FPGA byte generator/detector in VHDL from minimal specifications, and programmed a disease/population analysis program in Python.
- Designed & successfully operated an ultrasonic transducer circuit with minimal specifications.

## Proactivity & Preparedness
- Studied & practised OpenCV and additional Python-based modules prior to beginning the Rubik’s Cube Solving Robot project in Week 2 of studies.
- Took executive decisions regarding CitiBlox’s prototyping & equipment-handling situations, in addition to interpersonal issues amongst the Electronics Team.
- Undertook 3D-printing, CAD modelling, and laser-cutting inductions prior to CitiBlox’s electronics division leader role.
- Applied Git version control to our FPGA Digital Design & Embedded SoC Design Group Projects, and updated the repository daily. Backups are readily available & restored during occasional incidents, resulting in minimal work lost.

## Communication & Collaboration
- Presented my Arm internship’s project proposal to members within Functional Verification team. Organised project scope, approaches, and results into concise presentation topics.
- Developed communication skills & techniques essential to explaining difficult engineering concepts for children & students in the OutReach programme, including learning & understanding each individual’s needs.
- Formulated a detailed analysis & reflective report for both of my programming projects, and presented my results & reflections in a 1-to-1 interview.

## Teamwork & Leadership
- Leader of the Electronics Division of CitiBlox. Organised multiple team meetings with fellow team members, liaised with our sub-teams and other divisions, and arranged necessary equipment & purchases necessary for prototyping.
- Spearheaded & organised a team of 5 members to program & synthesise an Artix-7 FPGA board in order to formulate a data generator & peak detector (given the byte-stream from the former); achieved 80% overall.
- Deputy leader of my Professional Engineering group project. Organised group meetings & pre-arranged notes, discussion topics, and prerequisites amongst team members. Assigned tasks of the project’s report write-up to each individual team member to complete.
